# ProvarDemo
Provar Demonstration Tests

The tests in this project are for executing Provar against a standard Salesforce Enterprise Edition Org for the purposes of product demonstration. You're welcome to use these tests against your own org after adding your own User Connections.

Provar Testing accepts no responsibility for the ongoing maintenance or execution of these tests, they are not intended for use on a commercial basis, but are purely for demonstration and user training purposes.
